            Hello! My name is Carrie. I am currently a 6th grade social studies teacher at Smithfield Middle School in JOCO. I have previously taught 7th grade Social Studies and 6th grade English Language Arts.  I am one of the many transplants to NC. I am originally from Sleepy Hollow, IL. I moved to NC in 2016 after I graduated from Eastern Illinois University I do mean that literally right after graduation was a car ride to Raleigh. I recently adopted a Boston Terrier and her name is Charlie. She is currently 9 months old and extremly energetic.  At the middle school I work at I am the Cheerleading coach, on the AVID committee and in charge of updating the website. In my free time I enjoy hanging out with my family and friends.
