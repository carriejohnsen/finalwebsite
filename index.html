                I am currently a 6th Grade Social Studies teacher at Smithfield Middle School. This is the first time I
                am working with code. It's definitely going to be interesting semster. Im a graduate student, the
                Cheerleading Coach, and AVID team member.

            <ul>

                <li>
                    <h3>Quizlet</h3> I like quizlet because it allows students to learn new vocabulary in a new and fun
                    way. Students are then able to go back and review these words in different ways through matching
                    games, flashcards, and gravity. Students are also able to take practice vocabulary test.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Quizizz</h3>Another website that students are able to review new information or be introducuced
                    to a new topic.I have used Quiziss before to help my students learn the Mummification Process. This
                    website also allows for teachers to assign a Quizizz as a homework assignment or complete in class.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>EdPuzzle</h3>EdPuzzle is a site that allows students to watch a video and for teachers to check
                    for understanding as they are watching it. Video's can be assigned to be watched independently or
                    watched together as a class. During virtual teaching using EdPuzzle has allowed me to verify how
                    students are participating in class and paying attention.
